# 2-party-transactions-Remix-
There are lots of digital content creators/consultants across the globe. A big issue with them is late payment from consumers. They do the work but they aren't sure whether they will be paid on time. A solution for this problem is a recurring platform for freelancers where project owners can streamline the payment hourly, weekly, monthly basis.


The program can be tested in the following way:
- Paste the code into remix
- Deploy the contract 
- Set a value of ether to the value field in the remix ide and click the callable transact option for sending ethers to the smart contract
- Set the interval you wish to make the payments 
- Make the payment by entering the amount and adress of the creator


This function will continuously make payments to the creator on behalf of the consumer when the function is called. The function is open to both the creator and the consumer, hence the creator can also get the funds when appropriate time has passed.
